# odin-recipes

In this the odin-recipes project, I'll be building a website about food recipes. So I'll just be 
utilizing the some of the concepts that I learnt in the previous tutorials.

So the following is what I'll be demonstrating:-
1. The use of html documents as webpages
2. The use of head and body tags
3. Manipulation of child elements in the head tag
4. Manipulation of learnt child and sibling elements in the body tag
5. Playing with the styles that html has to offer
